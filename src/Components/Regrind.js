        <p>
          Recycled Grindings Inc. has the capability to shred both plastic and
          steel. When you need to dispose of plastic drums, steel drums and
          IBCâ€™s, our disposal and resource recovery system is capable of fully
          serving your needs. Following shredding, and granulation (if required)
          the remaining product is sent out for re-use in other applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your company can be confident that our process will render your
          expired IBC bottles and other disposable containers non-identifiable.
        </p>
        <p>
          For more information on this process or to request a quote, contact us
          today. The Lennox Container Group is always ready to answer any
          questions you may have.
